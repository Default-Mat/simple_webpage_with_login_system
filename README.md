# simple_webpage_with_login_system
This is a simple webpage with registration, login, and logout system using html, css, bootstrap,


javascript, php, and mysql.


Note: In signup.php we send a request to the "sample" database


using php which contains a table called "useracc" with two columns:


"username" and "password". The password will get hashed for security


purposes.
